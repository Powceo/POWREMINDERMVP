# Recommendations for Your POW Reminder System

## ‚úÖ Current Implementation Status

You now have a **fully functional local application** that:
- Parses Practice Fusion PDFs correctly
- Identifies only unconfirmed appointments
- Makes automated calls through Twilio
- Handles all IVR options (confirm/reschedule/cancel/stop)
- Stores all data locally in SQLite database
- Runs entirely on your Windows computer

## üéØ Recommended Improvements (Priority Order)

### 1. **Add Simple Call Retry Logic** (High Priority)
The current system attempts each call once. Add automatic retry:
- Wait 2 hours after no-answer
- Maximum 3 attempts per patient
- Stop if patient confirms/cancels

### 2. **Implement Batch Calling** (Medium Priority)
Instead of clicking "Call Now" for each patient:
- Add "Call All Unconfirmed" button
- Space calls 30 seconds apart
- Show progress bar
- Allow stopping mid-batch

### 3. **Add Basic Reports** (Medium Priority)
Track your success metrics:
- Daily confirmation rate
- No-show reduction percentage
- Call success vs voicemail rates
- Export to Excel for analysis

### 4. **Enhance Phone Number Handling** (Low Priority)
Currently handles standard formats well, but could improve:
- Handle extensions (x123)
- Multiple numbers per patient
- Text messaging preference flags

## üí° Operational Recommendations

### Optimal Call Times
Based on typical patient behavior:
- **Best times**: 10:30 AM - 12:00 PM, 1:30 PM - 3:00 PM
- **Avoid**: Lunch hour (12-1 PM)
- **Consider**: Evening hours for working patients

### Staff Training
1. **One person manages uploads** - Consistency is key
2. **Check dashboard periodically** - Every 30 minutes during call window
3. **Handle transfers quickly** - Staff should expect Press-2 transfers
4. **Document special cases** - Note patients who prefer texts/emails

### Testing Protocol
1. **Start with staff phones** - Test all options work
2. **Pilot with 5-10 patients** - One day's worth
3. **Gradual rollout** - Increase daily volume slowly
4. **Monitor feedback** - Track patient complaints/compliments

## üîí Security & Compliance

### Immediate Steps
1. **Restrict computer access** - Only authorized staff
2. **Lock computer** - When stepping away (Windows+L)
3. **Regular backups** - Copy database weekly
4. **Twilio BAA** - Sign before using real patient data

### Data Retention
- **Call logs**: Keep 90 days then archive
- **Appointment data**: Clear after appointment date passes
- **Database backups**: Keep 6 months
- **No recordings**: Already configured for compliance

## üìä Success Metrics to Track

Monitor these weekly:
1. **Confirmation rate increase** - Target: 20-30% improvement
2. **No-show reduction** - Target: 50% reduction
3. **Staff time saved** - Hours not spent calling manually
4. **Patient satisfaction** - Track complaints vs compliments

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What NOT to Change

These design decisions are correct:
1. **Local-only storage** - Perfect for your needs
2. **No call recording** - Simpler compliance
3. **Simple dashboard** - Easy for staff to use
4. **IVR menu options** - Cover all scenarios well
5. **Call window limits** - Respects patient preferences
